# systerm-requirements-and-design
- Answer the following questions:
- Consider the following statement of requirements for part of a
ticket-issuing system:
An automated ticket-issuing system sells rail tickets. Users select their
destination and input a credit card and a personal identification number.
The rail ticket is issued and their credit card account is charged. When the
user presses the start button, a menu display of potential destinations is
activated, along with a message to the user to select a destination. Once a
destination has been selected, users are requested to input their credit
card. Its validity is checked and the user is requested to input a personal
identifier. When the credit transaction has been validated, the ticket is
issued.
- Based on this:
- Discuss any ambiguities or omissions in the statement of
requirements for this part of a ticket-issuing system.
- Write a set of non-functional requirements for the ticket-issuing
system above. You are free to make assumptions regarding the
system based on ambiguities or omissions you identified previously.
