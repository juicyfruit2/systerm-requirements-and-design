Performance:

a. The system should be able to issue tickets quickly and efficiently, with minimal latency.

b. The system should be capable of handling a high volume of concurrent ticket requests without significant degradation in performance.

c. The response time for generating and issuing tickets should be within an acceptable range, typically less than X seconds, to provide a smooth user experience.


Reliability:

a. The system should be highly reliable and available, with minimal downtime or service interruptions.

b. The system should have appropriate backup and recovery mechanisms in place to prevent data loss in case of failures or disasters.

c. The system should be able to handle temporary network or hardware failures gracefully and recover without losing any critical data.


Security:

a. The system should enforce strict access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can issue tickets and modify relevant information.

b. User authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access to the ticket-issuing system.

c. Ticket data and customer information should be stored securely and protected from unauthorized access or tampering.





.YES
 
Good - reason is because the colour is appealing to the eye, the typorgaphy is good

.Yes 

Good - uses common UI elements consistently, the colour is has a warm good feel feeling to it and its very informative.

Bad - The best programs are designed in such a way that we donâ€™t have to learn how to use them.
